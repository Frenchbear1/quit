# QUIT

QUIT is a personal, single‑page web app I built to help me quit "corn". It keeps the focus on resisting urges, tracking streaks, and choosing a better action in the moment.

**Features**
- Streak tracking with "last relapse" time display
- One‑tap "DON'T DO IT." focus button
- Emergency verse overlay
- Guided exit actions with trigger logging
- Reality check prompts
- Verses tab
- Curated videos with "play later"
- Built‑in music player (mini + fullscreen)
- Local‑only storage (no accounts, no backend)
